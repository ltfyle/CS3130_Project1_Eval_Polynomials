# CS3130_Project1_Eval_Polynomials
## To Do List

   - [] Write the three algorithms that can evaluate a polynomial of the form: $P_{n}(X)=1+x+2x^{2}+3x^{3}+\\cdots+nx^{n}$, with x and n being limited to **integer numbers**",
        - Brute Force,
        - Repeated Squaring of Monomials,
        - Horner's Rule,
        - Output:,
            - Print: the time in milliseconds, the value of $P_{n}(X)$,
   - [] Round One **Accuracy**: ,
        - Make it such that the algorithms experience overflow ,
        - Handle the overflow error,
        - Test the algorithms on small samples for accuracy ,
   - [] Round Two **Testing on Large Data**,
        - Test the algorithms on a large x,n, such that the time is between two and five seconds,
       - Write the digit comparison program,
            - m = number of digits overall that are the same, given that the results have the same number of digits,
            - a,b -> the start and end point of a portion of digits between 10 and 20 digits long,
            - Output:,
                - m,
                - the portion of digits,
                - Should the digits be mismatched:,
                    print out the correct digits in green, and the mismatched digit in red,
   - [] Written Report,
        - Explain all results of each experiment,
        - Include screen shots of results\n"
